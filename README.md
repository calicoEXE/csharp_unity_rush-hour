# Rush Hour

Rush Hour is a fast-paced game where you race through a busy grocery store, grabbing ingredients for dinner before they disappear through the hands of other customers. You have to navigate the chaos of rush hour shopping to see if you can beat the clock and create the perfect meal.

As the sole Game Developer for Rush Hour, I crafted every aspect of the game, from level design to game mechanics and narrative. Rush Hour draws inspiration from my personal experiences as I return home from university during peak hours, rushing to the nearby Tesco store to grab groceries for dinner. The game centers around the anxiety and stress of ensuring that you can purchase groceries for the night to cook a decent meal.
